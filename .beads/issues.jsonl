{"id":"bd-3gm","title":"Add setup instructions to README","description":"## Problem\nRepository has no setup instructions. Users cannot figure out how to install or use bv. Ref: GH issue #1.\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### README Sections to Add\n1. Overview: What bv does (graph-aware triage engine for beads projects)\n2. Prerequisites: Rust toolchain, a beads project with .beads/beads.jsonl\n3. Installation: cargo install from source, binary download from releases\n4. Quick Start: Basic commands to get started\n5. Usage Modes:\n   - Interactive TUI: bv (launches TUI -- NEVER use from agents)\n   - Robot mode: bv --robot-triage, --robot-next, --robot-plan, etc.\n   - Export: bv --export-graph output.html\n6. Configuration: Any config files, env vars\n7. Integration with br: How bv reads from .beads/beads.jsonl\n8. Command Reference: Table of all --robot-* commands with descriptions\n9. jq Quick Reference: Common jq filters for robot output\n\n### Files to Modify\n- README.md (add all sections above)\n\n### Testing Plan\n\n#### Verification Script (new: scripts/verify_docs.sh)\n1. Parse each code example from README.md\n2. For examples that don't require a beads project: run them, verify they work\n3. For bv --help: verify all documented commands appear in help output\n4. For bv --robot-*: verify each documented command produces valid JSON\n5. Verify all mentioned file paths exist\n6. Verify installation instructions work: cargo build --release\n7. Log all output with timestamps\n8. Report PASS/FAIL per check\n\n### Edge Cases\n- README should note that bare bv launches TUI (blocks non-interactive sessions)\n- Document minimum beads.jsonl format required\n- Note that bv assumes a single repo context","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"docs","created_at":"2026-02-10T00:21:38.510995086Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-10T01:20:05.299343813Z","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0}
